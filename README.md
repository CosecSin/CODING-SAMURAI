## Some Insights

- From The Heatmap we can see that Price is heavily correlated
    with accomodities, beds, guest included, cleaning fee, weekly   monthly and security deposit price.

 - The graph shows the distribution of prices for Airbnb listings. The vast majority of listings are priced below $1,000. The most common price range is $100-$200. There are a small number of listings that are priced above $600.

- Most Preferred Room Was Entire Home/Aartment then Private Room and then Shared Room.

 - Mostly Review was Positive from the Reviewer.

 - The Most Visited City Was Broadway and Least is Roxhill.

 - Availability of room was in good number in peak season the unavailability also increases. Summer Season has the Highest Listing in all years.

 - By observing the highest and lowest points in the data, we can identify that the sales season is during summer. The sales season usually spans from May to September.
